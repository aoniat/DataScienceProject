First let's see what columns we have and how many missing data points we have for each.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
winemag <- read.csv("winemag-data-130k-v2.csv")
wine<-winemag

View(wine)
colnames(wine)
mymis<-c(0)
for (i in colnames(wine)){
mymis[i]<-length(which(wine[,i]=="" | is.na(wine[,i])))
}
mymis
```

Based on this, we'll probably use country, description, price, province and perhaps variety and winery for our recommendation system. So we'll filter out the ones that have a missing (or empty) 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

df<- wine %>% filter(!(country == "")) %>%
  filter(!(description == "")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(price)) %>%
  filter(!(region_1 =="")) %>%
  filter(!(title == ""))
  


```
